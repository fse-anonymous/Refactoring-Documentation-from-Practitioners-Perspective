Following changes are made:     - Create disk offering API now takes an extra parameter to denote storage type (local or shared). This is similar to storage type in service offering.     - Create/delete of data volume on local storage     - Attach/detach for local data volumes. Re-attach is allowed as long as vm host and data volume storage pool host is same.     - Migration of VM instance is not supported if it uses local root or data volumes.     - Migrate is not supported for local volumes.     - Zone level config to enable/disable local storage usage for service and disk offerings.     - Local storage gets discovered when a host is added/reconnected if zone level config is enabled. When disabled existing local storages are not removed but any new local storage is not added.     - Deploy VM command validates service and disk offerings based on local storage config.     - Upgrade uses the global config 'use.local.storage' to set the zone level config for local storage.
